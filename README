These are scripts that I've generated for various reasons. They're open for anyone to use, really.

- dissertation.py was my undergraduate dissertation code.
- lelbib.bst is a LaTeX bib style to match the Edinburgh undergraduate handbook.
- oliphaunt.py was my code for my undergraduate essay on Oliphaunt.
- thoor.tex is my LaTeX template blank style.
- vripper.praat is a praat script that grabs the formants needed from a transcribed file.
