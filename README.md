Other Codes
-----------

These are random scripts that I've generated for various reasons.

* Sailor.js is a little tutorial I made for a job interview teaching prototypical inheritance.
* dissertation.py was my undergraduate dissertation code.
* lelbib.bst is a LaTeX bib style to match the Edinburgh undergraduate handbook.
* oliphaunt.py was my code for my undergraduate essay on Oliphant 1996.
* thoor.tex is my LaTeX template blank style.
* vripper.praat is a praat script that grabs the formants needed from a transcribed file.
* choose_wisely.py basically picks a random movie for you to play, if you can't decide.
